# Network-Mapping-Home-Lab
Built and maintain a home lab for network asset management using nmap (-sn) for host discovery, SHA-256 hashes (sha256sum) to protect inventory integrity, and GPG (encrypt/sign/armor) to store signed, encrypted records, plus scheduled Cron scans to investigate unexpected or missing hosts.
